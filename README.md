#Swivel
Swivel is a robotic slide guitar system by [Jim Murphy](http://www.jimwmurphy.com)
This repository contains PCB files, CAD/CAM files, documentation on using all of them, and some very basic Arduino code for testing the board. 

##What's it good for?
Swivel is a sculptural object and a fun toy: it's an automatic instrument that allows composers to write computer music for physical objects. A composer could use popular music software (such as Ableton Live) to write songs which will be played back physically rather than through loudspeakers.

##Goal
I hope that this GitHub page will allow others to take my findings on mechatronic musical instruments and use them to leverage their own work on this burgeoning subfield of tech art. As such, I aim some of my documentation at novices: artists whose ambition and vision may outstrip their technical chops.

##What do I need to make my own?
Swivel is modular: Each string is its own unit. Many units can be stacked together to play in concert with one another. For one Swivel unit, you'll need:
* Mechanical components (laser cut parts, aluminium rod, guitar picks, etc.)
* Actuators (RC-style servos, standard size).
* Electronics (The Swivel PCB)
Please see this project's subdirectories for more information about the above requirements.

## History
Swivel is the latest in a line of musical robots that I've built. The version shown here is a revision of an earlier prototype. The earlier prototype, also called Swivel, used heavy-duty stepper motors and relatively expensive stepper motor drivers. It was built in conjunction with [MechBass](http://hackaday.com/2012/11/22/mechbass-a-robotic-bass-guitar-that-sounds-fantastic/). After evaluation and review, development of a second version (which is what this repository concerns) was initiated.

In my work on this and similar projects, I wrote [a history-oriented paper on automatic music](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo_music_journal/v022/22.murphy.html) which may be of interest to those who find Swivel compelling.

## How can I contribute?
Start by building a Swivel unit! Get in touch with me with questions and critiques and help with documentation.

But most of all, build your own system that's inspired by Swivel. Make music with it. Let the world know that musical robotics can result in worthwhile art.
